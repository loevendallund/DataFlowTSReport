	ReScript is a strongly typed language that targets
        JavaScript, as an alternative to gradually typed languages,
        such as TypeScript. In this paper, we present a sound type system
        for data-flow analysis for a subset of the ReScript language,
        more specifically for a $\lambda$-calculus with mutability and
        pattern matching. The type system is a local analysis that
        collects information about variables are used at each program
        point as well as alias information.
